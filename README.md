# eventor-api-openapi-spec

:warning: **NB:** this is an unofficial JSON version of the API. See
[orienteering-oss/eventor-api-openapi-spec](https://github.com/orienteering-oss/eventor-api-openapi-spec)
for an unofficial XML version (that is closer / equal to the official version of
the API).

[![Travis build status](https://app.travis-ci.com/orienteering-oss/eventor-api-openapi-spec-json.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/github/orienteering-oss/eventor-api-openapi-spec-json)

OpenAPI spec / Swagger for the Eventor API: [openapi.yml](./openapi.yml).

You can browse the
[Swagger UI](https://orienteering-oss.github.io/eventor-api-openapi-spec) for
this spec, but it will not work because of CORS. You can use it to browse and
create cURL commands that you can execute in your own terminal. Or you could
import the OpenAPI spec into Postman and make your calls from there.

**What is Eventor?** Eventor is the event system for
[orienteering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering) races in different
countries, so if you want to arrange an orienteering event, you will probably
register it in your local Eventor system to make other people see it and for
them to register to your event (and where you can upload results after the event
is done).

## Usage of the Eventor API

To use the Eventor API, you need an API key.

The different Eventor websites are:

- [Norwegian Eventor](https://eventor.orientering.no/)
- [Swedish Eventor](https://eventor.orientering.se/)
- [Australian Eventor](https://eventor.orienteering.asn.au/)
- [International Eventor](https://eventor.orienteering.org/)

Add `/api/documentation` to either of the URLs to get the documentation for that
particular Eventor website (the documentation is also included in the OpenAPI
specification).
